# Project on VBA
This is a project based on VBA in which I try to automate some excel work related to HR purpose.

After Making salary slip it automaticaly save in a define folder with thier employee code and name Ex: (Name = Rony, code = 34246) so file name would be 34246_Rony.
And then I configure the outlook with this program.
So. when running a loop it creates a mail and type a receiver email from the give data in TO box and type a subject automaticaly and also type a mail body and attached a attachment of salary slip in PDF format and send a email one by one till given data.
